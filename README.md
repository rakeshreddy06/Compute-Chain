# Compute-Chain

   Compute chain

Attempting to implement compute-sharing software with the aid of idle devices, which can be shared for computations and compensated with tokens for the computation cycles

Scope:  able to achieve computing by using at least 2 computing devices that are willing to compute for a single task.

The device can be an idle laptop 
Use of tokens for compensating compute power given


Phase 1 Difficulties:  

How to network between two devices
How the other nodes join a pool
How smart contracts need to be built
How tokens need to be sent to an account
How data need to to handles


Existing Projects for reference: 
Golem networks


Prototyping tools used:
Python
Spark Hadoop
